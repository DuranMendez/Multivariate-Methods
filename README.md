## Relationships among homelesness factors  

In this project, we apply descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and Factor Analysis to explore patterns and underlying connections in the data. This allows us to demonstrate the use of multivariate statistical techniques while examining the relationships among homelessness, evictions, and related socioeconomic factors.
